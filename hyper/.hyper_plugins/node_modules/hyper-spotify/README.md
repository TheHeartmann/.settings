- `top`
- `bottom` (default)

To specify where `hyper-spotify` bar should appear just add the following to your `~/.hyper.js` config section
```js
modules.exports = {
  config: {
    ...
    hyperSpotify: {
      position: 'top' // or 'bottom'
    },
    ...
  },
  ... 
};
```

## Limitations
Currently works only on macOS

## Troubleshooting

### Can't load `hyper-spotify`
Unfortunately this seems to be a common issue with `Hyper` plugins (see here [zeit/hyper#191](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/191))

After installing `hyper-spotify` if `Hyper`Â complains about an error while enabling the plugin:
- do a full restart of `Hyper` app

if even after restaring the issue persists try running the following command
```bash
$ cd ~/.hyper_plugins && npm install
```

## Credits

This plugin is inspired by [`atom-spotify2`](https://github.com/albertorestifo/atom-spotify2) and uses [`spotify-node-applescript`](https://github.com/andrehaveman/spotify-node-applescript) to interact with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) client on macOS
